Memoirs theme has Prism highlighter integrated. I will show you in this post a few examples of how it looks if you are a developer planning to add pieces of code on your website.


#### HTML

```html
<li class="ml-1 mr-1">
    <a target="_blank" href="#">
    <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
    </a>
</li>
```

#### CSS

```css
.highlight .c {
    color: #999988;
    font-style: italic; 
}
.highlight .err {
    color: #a61717;
    background-color: #e3d2d2; 
}
```

#### JS

```js
// alertbar later
$(document).scroll(function () {
    var y = $(this).scrollTop();
    if (y > 280) {
        $('.alertbar').fadeIn();
    } else {
        $('.alertbar').fadeOut();
    }
});
```

#### Python

```python
print("Hello World")
```

#### Ruby

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

#### C

```c
printf("Hello World");
```

#### What critiques say?

> "There's almost no single moment in Portrait of a Lady on Fire that couldn't be captured, mounted, and hung on a wall as high art." <cite>— Entertainment Weekly</cite>

<span class="spoiler">A major clue to everything that truly happened was the scene that played next under the credits - hospital staff failed to bring a patient back to life with a defibrillator after a car accident. Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies. Now, there's a mystery worth solving. Probably the biggest mystery there is.<span>
#### So how do we add spoilers in this theme?
